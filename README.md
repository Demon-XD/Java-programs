# Java-programs
A repo for my Java Programs, feel free to use any part of the code, just make sure to give me credit!

This is a readme file containing of a brief description of the programs included in this package.
All of the programs in the package Vedant, are made by me,
Vedant Jadhav and every program is based on my logic.

The programs in the package are listed below with their brief descriptions:
1. CaesarCipher.java (A program for encrypting and decrypting any text using the caesar cipher.)
2. Calculator.java (A program for a calculator taking infinite inputs.)
3. Main.java (A program made for the sole purpose of executing all the other programs.)
4. RandomNumberGenerator.java (A program made for generating random numbers, taking lower and upper limits
    as parameters.)
5. VigenereCipher.java (A program for encrypting and decrypting any text using the vigenere cipher.)
6. UpperLower.java (A program for guessing what the random number is. Inspired by the Discord bot Dank Memer.)
7. TicTacToe.java (A program for playing TicTacToe!)
8. Anagram.java (A program to check if two words are anagrams of each other or not!)

Please note:
1. All of the programs except Main.java and TicTacToe.java do NOT have a main method.
2. You CANNOT download any program separately and expect the program to work properly. If you want to do so, please delete the first line (package Java-programs) in the program.
3. The Casino.java program is not listed as it is currently suspended. Feel free to make any changes or suggest them on my discord, given in my profile!

Any other programs which are in this package are just made by me for fun, and have no primary use.
